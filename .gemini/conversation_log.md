# Conversation Log

This file tracks the progress of our work on "Assignment Two".

**Instruction for Gemini:** This file must be updated at the end of each interaction or upon completion of a task to ensure a persistent record of the project's state.

## Session 1: 2025-07-12

### Initial Setup & Planning
- **Objective:** Understand and begin work on "Assignment Two".
- **Files Reviewed:** The primary brief (`assignment-two.md`) has been moved to the `.gemini` directory for reference. The `.html` version has been deleted.
- **Key Requirements Understood:**
    - Design and implement a database using both PostgreSQL (Object-Relational) and MongoDB (Document Store).
    - The project involves 6 tasks: UML Diagram, PostgreSQL implementation, MongoDB implementation, a comparative discussion, and developing equivalent queries for both systems.
    - Submission requires a technical report, a `.sql` script, a `.js`/`.json` script, and a cover sheet, all in a single ZIP file.

### Task 1: Case Study and UML Diagram
- **Case Study Selection:**
    - Discussed several options (Online Learning, Project Management, Healthcare).
    - Selected a developer-focused theme: **"Source Code Repository Management System"**.
    - Refined the scope to keep it manageable.
- **Entities Defined (5 total):**
    1.  `User`: The developer.
    2.  `Repository`: The project container.
    3.  `Commit`: A snapshot of code changes. Includes an array of changed file paths.
    4.  `Issue`: A bug or feature request. Uses a string attribute `issueType` for classification ('Bug', 'FeatureRequest') instead of inheritance for simplicity.
    5.  `Comment`: A message attached to an issue.
- **Task 1 Completion:**
    - A UML class diagram was created in Mermaid syntax.
    - A 200-word critical discussion was written, justifying the design choices (aggregation, use of `issueType`, and the `changedFiles` array).
    - The diagram and discussion were saved to the file `task1-uml-diagram.md`.

### Session Management & File Organization
- **Decision:** To store all conversation history and state in a local file instead of Gemini's internal memory for user visibility and control.
- **Action:**
    - Created `.gemini/conversation_log.md` to track progress.
    - Created `.gemini/GEMINI.md` with instructions for the assistant.
    - Moved `assignment-two.md` into the `.gemini` directory to consolidate project-related materials.
    - Deleted the redundant `assignment-two.html` file.

## Session 2: 2025-07-13

### Task 1: UML Diagram Refinement
- **Objective:** Refine the UML diagram to more explicitly use inheritance.
- **Action:**
    - Modified the `Issue` entity in `task1-uml-diagram.md` to be an abstract class.
    - Created two new classes, `Bug` and `FeatureRequest`, that inherit from `Issue`.
    - This change better reflects the "inheritance hierarchies" requirement in the assignment brief.

### Task 1: Rationale Update
- **Objective:** Update the rationale in `task1-uml-diagram.md` to reflect the new inheritance structure.
- **Action:**
    - The rationale was updated to explain the new inheritance hierarchy and how it addresses the assignment requirements.

### Task 1: Final Review
- **Objective:** Review the UML diagram and rationale against the assignment criteria.
- **Action:**
    - I analyzed the current work and determined that it meets the "Exceeds expected standard" criteria.
    - I suggested an optional improvement (adding a many-to-many relationship) to further enhance the model.
    - The user decided to keep the current scope and not add the many-to-many relationship.

**Next Step:**
- **Proceed with Task 2:** Write the complete SQL script to implement the defined design as a PostgreSQL object-relational database. This includes creating types, tables, constraints, and inserting sample data.

## Session 3: 2025-07-27

### Task 2: PostgreSQL Implementation
- **Objective:** Implement the database schema in PostgreSQL.
- **Action:**
    - Created the complete SQL script `postgres/queries.sql`.
    - The script defines all necessary types, tables (including inheritance for `Issue`), and constraints.
    - Sample data was added for all entities to ensure the model is populated.

### Task 1: Diagram Recreation
- **Objective:** Recreate the UML diagram in Draw.io format.
- **Action:**
    - The Mermaid diagram from `task1-uml-diagram.md` was converted into the Draw.io XML format.
    - The new diagram was saved to `class-diagram.drawio`, overwriting the previous example file.

**Next Step:**
- Execute the PostgreSQL script to create the database.
- Proceed with Task 3: Implement the schema in MongoDB.

## Session 4: 2025-07-28

### Task 2: PostgreSQL Refinement
- **Objective:** Address an error in the foreign key constraints of the `comments` table.
- **Action:**
    - Modified the `comments` table in `postgres/queries.sql` to allow comments to be associated with either an `issue` or a `commit`.
    - The `issue_id` column was made nullable.
    - A new `commit_hash` column was added with a foreign key reference to the `commits` table.
    - A `CHECK` constraint was added to ensure that a comment is linked to either an issue or a commit, but not both.
    - The sample data was updated to include a comment on a commit.
- **Reasoning:** This change provides a more flexible and realistic data model, where discussions can happen on both issues and specific commits.

### Session End: 2025-07-28

**Next Step:**
- Proceed with Task 3: Implement the schema in MongoDB.

## Session 5: 2025-07-30

### Task 2: PostgreSQL Reset
- **Objective:** Reset the PostgreSQL script to a clean, simple template.
- **Action:**
    - The content of `postgres/queries.sql` was completely replaced.
    - The new script contains a basic example with `users`, `posts`, and `comments` tables, including `DROP`, `CREATE`, `INSERT`, and `SELECT` statements.
- **Reasoning:** This provides a clean slate to build the required object-relational schema from scratch, as requested.
