## Session 1: 2025-07-12

### Initial Setup & Planning
- **Objective:** Understand and begin work on "Assignment Two".
- **Files Reviewed:** The primary brief (`assignment-two.md`) has been moved to the `.gemini` directory for reference. The `.html` version has been deleted.
- **Key Requirements Understood:**
    - Design and implement a database using both PostgreSQL (Object-Relational) and MongoDB (Document Store).
    - The project involves 6 tasks: UML Diagram, PostgreSQL implementation, MongoDB implementation, a comparative discussion, and developing equivalent queries for both systems.
    - Submission requires a technical report, a `.sql` script, a `.js`/`.json` script, and a cover sheet, all in a single ZIP file.

### Task 1: Case Study and UML Diagram
- **Case Study Selection:**
    - Discussed several options (Online Learning, Project Management, Healthcare).
    - Selected a developer-focused theme: **"Source Code Repository Management System"**.
    - Refined the scope to keep it manageable.
- **Entities Defined (5 total):**
    1.  `User`: The developer.
    2.  `Repository`: The project container.
    3.  `Commit`: A snapshot of code changes. Includes an array of changed file paths.
    4.  `Issue`: A bug or feature request. Uses a string attribute `issueType` for classification ('Bug', 'FeatureRequest') instead of inheritance for simplicity.
    5.  `Comment`: A message attached to an issue.
- **Task 1 Completion:**
    - A UML class diagram was created in Mermaid syntax.
    - A 200-word critical discussion was written, justifying the design choices (aggregation, use of `issueType`, and the `changedFiles` array).
    - The diagram and discussion were saved to the file `task1-uml-diagram.md`.

### Session Management & File Organization
- **Decision:** To store all conversation history and state in a local file instead of Gemini's internal memory for user visibility and control.
- **Action:**
    - Created `.gemini/conversation_log.md` to track progress.
    - Created `.gemini/GEMINI.md` with instructions for the assistant.
    - Moved `assignment-two.md` into the `.gemini` directory to consolidate project-related materials.
    - Deleted the redundant `assignment-two.html` file.

## Session 2: 2025-07-13

### Task 1: UML Diagram Refinement
- **Objective:** Refine the UML diagram to more explicitly use inheritance.
- **Action:**
    - Modified the `Issue` entity in `task1-uml-diagram.md` to be an abstract class.
    - Created two new classes, `Bug` and `FeatureRequest`, that inherit from `Issue`.
    - This change better reflects the "inheritance hierarchies" requirement in the assignment brief.

### Task 1: Rationale Update
- **Objective:** Update the rationale in `task1-uml-diagram.md` to reflect the new inheritance structure.
- **Action:**
    - The rationale was updated to explain the new inheritance hierarchy and how it addresses the assignment requirements.

### Task 1: Final Review
- **Objective:** Review the UML diagram and rationale against the assignment criteria.
- **Action:**
    - I analyzed the current work and determined that it meets the "Exceeds expected standard" criteria.
    - I suggested an optional improvement (adding a many-to-many relationship) to further enhance the model.
    - The user decided to keep the current scope and not add the many-to-many relationship.

### Task 2: PostgreSQL Implementation
- **Objective:** Implement the database schema in PostgreSQL.
- **Action:**
    - Created the complete SQL script `postgres/queries.sql`.
    - The script defines all necessary types, tables (including inheritance for `Issue`), and constraints.
    - Sample data was added for all entities to ensure the model is populated.

### Task 1: Diagram Recreation
- **Objective:** Recreate the UML diagram in Draw.io format.
- **Action:**
    - The Mermaid diagram from `task1-uml-diagram.md` was converted into the Draw.io XML format.
    - The new diagram was saved to `class-diagram.drawio`, overwriting the previous example file.

## Session 4: 2025-07-28

### Task 2: PostgreSQL Refinement
- **Objective:** Address an error in the foreign key constraints of the `comments` table.
- **Action:**
    - Modified the `comments` table in `postgres/queries.sql` to allow comments to be associated with either an `issue` or a `commit`.
    - The `issue_id` column was made nullable.
    - A new `commit_hash` column was added with a foreign key reference to the `commits` table.
    - A `CHECK` constraint was added to ensure that a comment is linked to either an issue or a commit, but not both.
    - The sample data was updated to include a comment on a commit.
- **Reasoning:** This change provides a more flexible and realistic data model, where discussions can happen on both issues and specific commits.

## Session 5: 2025-07-30

### Task 2: PostgreSQL Reset
- **Objective:** Reset the PostgreSQL script to a clean, simple template.
- **Action:**
    - The content of `postgres/queries.sql` was completely replaced.
    - The new script contains a basic example with `users`, `posts`, and `comments` tables, including `DROP`, `CREATE`, `INSERT`, and `SELECT` statements.
- **Reasoning:** This provides a clean slate to build the required object-relational schema from scratch, as requested.

### Task 1: UML Diagram and Rationale Refinement
- **Objective:** Refine the UML diagram and its rationale to correctly represent all required OOP concepts.
- **Action:**
    - Updated the Mermaid diagram in `task1-uml-diagram.md` to correctly distinguish between Aggregation (`Repository o-- Commit`) and Composition (`Repository *-- Issue`, `Issue *-- Comment`).
    - Rewrote the rationale to clearly define and justify the use of all four relationship types: Association, Inheritance, Aggregation, and Composition, as implemented in the diagram.
- **Reasoning:** This ensures the UML diagram and its explanation are accurate and fully meet the assignment's requirements for demonstrating complex relationships.

### Task 1: Draw.io Diagram Synchronization
- **Objective:** Synchronize the Draw.io diagram with the updated Mermaid diagram.
- **Action:**
    - Modified the `class-diagram.drawio` file to update the relationships.
    - Changed the `Repository-Issue` and `Issue-Comment` relationships to Composition (filled diamond) and updated their labels to "contains".
    - Ensured the `Repository-Commit` relationship remained as Aggregation (open diamond).
- **Reasoning:** This keeps the visual Draw.io diagram consistent with the Mermaid diagram and the documented rationale.

### Task 2: PostgreSQL Implementation (Continued)
- **Objective:** Build the object-relational schema in `postgres/queries.sql` step-by-step and complete data population.
- **Action (Schema):**
    - Added `DROP` statements for all tables and types to ensure a clean slate.
    - Defined the `issue_status` ENUM type.
    - Created the `users`, `repositories`, `commits`, `issues` (parent), `bugs` (child), `feature_requests` (child), and `comments` tables.
- **Action (Data Population):**
    - Populated all tables with sample data in a sequential, step-by-step process, starting with `users` and ending with `comments`.
- **Debugging (Foreign Key Inheritance):**
    - **Problem:** Encountered a foreign key violation when inserting comments linked to issues. This is a known PostgreSQL limitation where a foreign key on a parent table (`issues`) does not see the data in its child tables (`bugs`, `feature_requests`).
    - **Solution:** Replaced the standard foreign key constraint with a trigger. A function (`check_issue_exists`) was created to manually verify that the `issue_id` exists in the `issues` hierarchy before an insert/update on the `comments` table.
- **Debugging (Trigger Syntax):**
    - **Problem:** The `CREATE FUNCTION` statement failed due to a syntax error when the script was executed. The `psql` client misinterpreted the `$$` delimiters.
    - **Solution:** Modified the trigger function definition to use named dollar quoting (`$FUNCTION$`), which provides a more robust way to define the function body and resolves the syntax error.
- **Status:** The `postgres/queries.sql` script is now complete and executes successfully, fully creating and populating the object-relational database as per the requirements for Task 2.

## Session 7: 2025-07-31

### Task 5: PostgreSQL Queries
- **Objective:** Develop the five required SQL queries as per the assignment brief.
- **Query 5a (Multi-Join):**
    - Implemented as a stored procedure `get_comprehensive_commit_details()`.
    - Joins four tables (`users`, `repositories`, `commits`, `comments`) using `INNER JOIN` and `LEFT JOIN`.
    - Includes a `WHERE` clause to restrict results based on the size of the `changed_files` array.
    - Added a `CALL` statement to execute the procedure and a `SELECT` to display the results from the temporary table it creates.
- **Query 5b (Set Operator):**
    - Implemented as a stored procedure `get_active_users()`.
    - Uses the `UNION` operator to combine the results of two `SELECT` statements, finding all users who have either authored a commit or reported a bug.
    - Involves joins between three tables (`users`, `commits`, `bugs`).
    - Added a `CALL` statement and a `SELECT` to show the results.
- **Query 5c (Inheritance/Array & Stored Function):**
    - Implemented as a stored function `get_bugs_for_repository(p_repo_id INT)` to fulfill the stored function requirement.
    - The query selects directly from the `bugs` table, demonstrating a query on an inherited table.
    - It also calculates the age of the bug report using the `AGE()` temporal function.
    - Added a `SELECT` statement to execute the function and display its results.
