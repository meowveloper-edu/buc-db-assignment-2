# Gemini Project Configuration

This file contains instructions and configuration for the Gemini assistant.

## Core Instructions
- **Assignment Brief:** All work must strictly follow the requirements outlined in the `.gemini/assignment-two.md` file. This is the primary source of truth for all tasks.
- **Conversation Logging:** At the end of each interaction or when a task is completed, I must update the `.gemini/conversation_log.md` file. This log serves as a persistent, local record of our progress.
